Exploration of different masks for edge detection and water identification

Part 1: Data Preprocessing
    The change dataset offers a continuous scale of water presence. Converting
areas with/without the presence of water/data to a desirable value is trivial 
with sufficient computing power. A potential solution is Hadoop MapReduce, 
although non-parallelized methods may work too. 

Part 2: Edge Detection
    Vertical and horizontal edges can be detected by applying a sobel function
to the processed data. Essentially, the sobel function highlights pixels that
are next to a sharp gradient. This will draw outlines of water bodies and will
help distinguish river channels from wetlands and lakes. 

Part 3: Body Identification
    Some initial ideas to identify water bodies would be to use an sklearn 
clustering algorithm, such as DBSCAN, to group water bodies. This will provide
preliminary metrics for clustering water bodies. Some additional convolutions,
similar to the Sobel function, may be considered to identify differing bodies
of water
    
Part 4: Errors and Exceptions
    The scale of the datapoints lends some speculations as to the meaning of 
'100% increase'. Presumably, this means there was water 100% of the time from 
in the second epoch. There are some compression artifacts present in the 
dataset that disrupt the accuracy of continuity. Additionally, it may be 
relevant to explore any effects of map warpage in the dataset. There are also 
areas with no data that includes many smaller tributaries
